# 🔐 Encoder-Decoder
This Python-based Encoder-Decoder application allows users to convert text to numerical representations and vice versa. The encoding converts each letter into its corresponding position in the English alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), while the decoding reverses the process to retrieve the original text. Non-alphabetical characters are preserved as-is, ensuring seamless conversion for mixed input.

## ✨ Features
- Encoding: Converts text to numbers, making it easy to obfuscate simple messages.
- Decoding: Converts numerical representations back into text for easy retrieval.
- Flexible Input: Handles both alphabetical and non-alphabetical characters without loss.
## 🔧 How to Use
- Run the script ▶️.
  - Choose an option:
1 for encoding text to numbers.
2 for decoding numbers back to text.
  - Enter the text or encoded sequence as prompted.
  - View the encoded or decoded result instantly 🌟.
## 🚀 Example

### Encoding:
- Input: Hello, World!
- Output: 8 5 12 12 15 , 23 15 18 12 4 !
### Decoding:
- Input: 8 5 12 12 15 , 23 15 18 12 4 !
- Output: HELLO, WORLD!

This program is a fun way to explore text transformation and simple ciphers. Feel free to modify the code to add additional features or adapt it to your needs!
